# Odin Binary Search Trees

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure as part of The Odin Project's curriculum, showcasing how to efficiently manage sorted data through operations like insertion, traversal, and balancing.

## Features

- **Node Class**: Represents each node with data, left, and right children.
- **Tree Class**: Initializes with an array to create a balanced BST.
- **Build Tree**: Converts an array into a balanced binary tree by sorting and removing duplicates.
- **Insert and Delete**: Inserts a new value into the tree, and Deletes a value from the tree, handling multiple cases.
- **Find**: Returns the node with the specified value.
- **Traversals**:
  - `levelOrder`: Breadth-first traversal.
  - `inOrder`, `preOrder`, `postOrder`: Depth-first traversals.
- **Height and Depth**: Returns the height and depth of the specified node.
- **Balance Check**: Checks if the tree is balanced.
- **Rebalance**: Rebalances the tree if it's unbalanced.

## How to Run

```bash
node bst.js
```
